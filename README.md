## Get Started with the React Client

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br  />

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.  

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

Install the required packages<br  />

<br/>

## Proxy to PAB Server

This avoids  [CORS issues](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21854516/understanding-ajax-cors-and-security-considerations)  and error messages like this in development:
`Fetch API cannot load http://localhost:9080/api/... No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:3000' is therefore not allowed access. If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.`
